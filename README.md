# CS4248 G17 NLP Project - Demo A2


The purpose of this demo branch is to show how the `main.py`, `data.py` and `model.py` interacts with each other by emulating
the input & output of CS4248 Assignment 2. 

It is also used as a proof of concept when developing the skeleton code.

This demo is code-named as `subtask0`, i.e. run `python3 main.py 0`.

- `main.py` - main runner file of the project
- `data.py` - loads, pre-processes data and implements the `NcgDatasetDemo` class, modified to fit the a2 dataset requirements
- `model.py` - implements the `NcgModelDemo` class, minimally modified to load `subtask0` modules
- `subtask0/model0.py` - subtask 0 implementations
